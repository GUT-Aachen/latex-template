	abstract = {'Engineering geology' is one of those terms that invite definition. The American Geological Institute, for example, has expanded the term to mean 'the application of the geological sciences to engineering practice for the purpose of assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation and mainten ance of engineering works are recognized and adequately provided for'. It has also been defined by W.R. Judd in the {McGraw}-Hill Encyclopaedia of Science and Technology as 'the application of education and experience in geology and other geosciences to solve geological problems posed by civil engineering structures'. Judd goes on to specify those branches of the geological or geo-sciences as surface (or surficial) geology, structural/fabric geology, geohydro logy, geophysics, soil and rock mechanics. Soil mechanics is firmly included as a geological science in spite of the perhaps rather unfortunate trends over the years (now happily being reversed) towards purely mechanistic analyses which may well provide acceptable solutions for only the simplest geology. Many subjects evolve through their subject areas from an interdisciplinary background and it is just such instances that pose the greatest difficulties of definition. Since the form of educational development experienced by the practitioners of the subject ulti mately bears quite strongly upon the corporate concept of the term 'engineering geology', it is useful briefly to consider that educational background.},

	title = {Dynamic Hydraulic Fracture Modeling for Wellbore Integrity Prediction in a Porous Medium},
	abstract = {We present a workflow for modeling dynamic growth of hydraulically induced fractures in a porous medium in the near-wellbore region. The focus is on the early time fracture growth behavior and the stress state near the wellbore as a result of it. The model is based on the Cohesive Zone Model ({CZM}) elements with pore pressure degrees of freedom, which were co-developed with {ExxonMobil} Upstream Research Company and recently implemented into the Abaqus finite element package. In addition to including the physics of dynamic fracture growth and pore pressure diffusion, the model allows for fluid leak-off from the wellbore and fracture faces into the porous medium, as well as an arbitrary injection schedule. The dynamic fracture growth and interaction between the stress concentration region near the tip and the wellbore result in a non-linear behavior of the near-wellbore stress state during early time fracture propagation. This analysis allows for a recommendation of optimum fracture width for a corresponding maximum increase in wellbore integrity for the target formation. The model also provides an effective tool to improve the treatment selection (e.g., particle size distribution for effective treatment), as well as field diagnostics for various lost circulation treatments and lost returns events. The model is incorporated into a fully automated workflow which allows the user to setup the analysis without any previous experience with Abaqus.},

	abstract = {The problem of a fluid-driven (hydraulic) fracture propagating in a porous medium is studied using recently co-developed capabilities in {SIMULIA}® Abaqus Standard (“Abaqus”) for fully-coupled simulation of hydraulic fracturing. The hydraulic fracturing simulation capabilities are validated against lab-scale experimental results. A Polyaxial Test Cell ({PTC}) is set up for controlled hydraulic fracturing in fabricated rock samples allowing different testing conditions of confining stress, injection rate, and rock and fluid properties. Two representative regimes of fracture propagation (toughness/storage and viscosity/leak-off) are selected to compare against numerical simulations carried out in Abaqus. Fracture propagation and fracturing fluid flow are modeled using coupled pressure/deformation cohesive elements, while the porous medium deformation and pore-fluid flow in the rock are modeled with coupled “pore-pressure/deformation” continuum finite elements. Injection pressure response and fracture and leak-off geometries agree well with corresponding experimental results. The experimental validation of the newly co-developed hydraulic fracturing simulation capabilities within Abaqus provides confidence for accurately modeling field-scale, fluid-driven fracturing applications including drill cuttings and water injection, stimulation of unconventional reservoirs, lost returns and other drilling operations.},

	abstract = {Reservoir depletion results in rock failure, wellbore instability, hydrocarbon production loss, oil sand production, and ground surface subsidence. Specifically, the compaction of carbonate reservoirs with soft rocks often induces large plastic deformation due to rock pore collapse. On the other hand, following the compaction of reservoirs and failure of rock formations, the porosity and permeability of formations will, in general, decrease. These bring a challenge for reservoir simulations because of high nonlinearity of coupled geomechanics and fluid flow fields. In this work, we present a fully implicit, fully coupled, and fully consistent finite element formulation for coupled geomechanics and fluid flow problems with finite deformation and nonlinear flow models. The Pelessone smooth cap plasticity model, an important material model to capture rock compaction behavior and a challenging material model for implicit numerical formulations, is incorporated in the proposed formulation. Furthermore, a stress-dependent permeability model is taken into account in the formulation. A co-rotational framework is adopted for finite deformation, and an implicit material integrator for cap plasticity models is consistently derived. Furthermore, the coupled field equations are consistently linearized including nonlinear flow models. The physical theories, nonlinear material and flow models, and numerical formulations are the focus of part I of this work. In part {II}, we verify the proposed numerical framework and demonstrate the performance of our numerical formulation using several numerical examples including a field reservoir with soft rocks undergoing serious compaction.},

	abstract = {A fully implicit, fully coupled, and fully consistent finite element framework has been formulated in part I of this work for modeling reservoir compaction through linearizing coupled solid and flow field equations and constructing a local material integrator. In part {II} of this work, we focus on verification and performance analysis of our numerical formulation and computer implementation using several numerical examples. First, we design a cube problem in triaxial compression to verify our numerical formulation and computer code implementation especially for rock formation in compaction using cap plasticity models. The finite element prediction on stresses is compared with the analytical solution. The second problem we select is a strip footing problem popular in the geotechnical area where the evolution of soil consolidation degrees following the diffusion of pore pressure is the main interest. In this example, we demonstrate a good performance of the proposed numerical formulation on solving different shear and compaction-dominated deformation behaviors by varying the footing length. Importantly, an extremely sharp cap model based on real experimental data for Leda clays, a challenging cap model, is successfully applied in this footing problem. Our focus in this work is to model field reservoirs undergoing serious compaction. A reservoir with complex payzone geometries, multiple horizontal wells, and cap plasticity models with sharp cap surfaces has been successfully solved using our fully implicit formulation. The last example is to model a horizontal wellbore damage problem. Finally, the sensitivity of predicted subsidence to nonlinear flow model, cap hardening parameters, and Lode angles have been systemically investigated and documented in detail, which can provide a constructive guidance on how to successfully model field reservoir compaction problems with cap plasticity models.},

	abstract = {Particle morphological features at different scale levels hold the key to understanding the geological origin and mechanical behaviour of natural sands. In this context, it is necessary to characterise and quantify these morphological features by defining a series of reasonable descriptors. In this study, based on X-ray micro-computed tomographic (μ{CT}) images collected from a series of image-processing techniques, the authors first introduced spherical harmonic analysis to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) realistic surface of the sand particles. Then 3D sphericity, roundness and fractal dimension were introduced to define the global form, local features and surface textures of the particle morphology. Based on the spherical harmonic–reconstructed surface, a novel framework was established to measure the descriptors of 3D sphericity, roundness and fractal dimension of sand particles. The 3D fractal dimension was an original descriptor used to characterise the fractal nature of the surface textures of real sand particle morphology. By using the proposed methods, these morphological descriptors were measured for two types of natural sand particle. The statistical results show clear correlations between different descriptors at different characteristic scales. The correlation relies heavily upon the distance between the characteristic scales of the morphological descriptors.},

	abstract = {Bright white sands consisting almost exclusively of quartz (sometimes called ‘silver sands’) occur throughout the world; those in Europe commonly date from the late Paleogene and early Neogene. They have a clearly sedimentary origin, and they may have originated in various types of environments, but precise data are lacking because sedimentary research into these deposits (that have a high economic value) has been scarce. It is most likely that diagenetic processes are largely responsible for their exceptional appearance, but it is highly unlikely that all silver sands were subject to the same diagenetic conditions.
The precise origin of most of the silver sands is still enigmatic. In the case of the silver sands in the Dutch/German/Belgian border area, it appears that long-lasting in situ leaching by humic acids (resulting in an extremely low percentage of heavy minerals), in combination with differential cementation (and later partial dissolution of the cement), must be held responsible for the wide variety of the characteristics of these sands, including locally sharp boundaries with the underlying sands, lack of precipitates at the contact plane with the underlying sands, and the joint occurrence of strongly weathered and fresh specimens of the same heavy-mineral species.},

	abstract = {This study is an introduction to the theory of three-dimensional
consolidation. The point of departure in the description are the basic
equations of elasticity (i.e. constitutive law, equations of equilibrium in
terms of stresses, and the definition of strain), together with the principle
of effective stress, and the law of Darcy for fluid flow in porous media. These
equations, together with the principle of mass conservation, are the only
premises used to derive a drained description of consolidation theory. Next,
the increment of fluid content is defined and its constitutive law is derived -
with its derivation following naturally from the equation of fluid mass
balance. Pore pressure, storage, and undrained coefficients are also introduced
and useful relations are proven. Where appropriate, the physical meaning of
these coefficients is proven mathematically. Equations of equilibrium and fluid
mass conservation are subsequently expressed in terms of the increment of fluid
content and undrained coefficients, leading to an undrained description of
consolidation theory. Thus the initial approach of using drained description is
extended to the formalism of Rice and Cleary. This approach to
three-dimensional consolidation is useful for its simplicity. It does not
require the ad-hoc definition of constants and that of an elastic energy
potential. Instead, it is a direct extension to linear elasticity that accounts
for the coupling of skeletal deformations and fluid behaviour.},

	abstract = {The theory of linear poroelasticity describes the interaction between mechanical effects and adding or removing fluid from rock. It is critical to the study of such geological phenomena as earthquakes and landslides and is important for numerous engineering projects, including dams, groundwater withdrawal, and petroleum extraction. Now an advanced text synthesizes in one place, with one notation, numerous classical solutions and applications of this highly useful theory. The introductory chapter recounts parallel developments in geomechanics, hydrogeology, and reservoir engineering that are unified by the tenets of poroelasticity. Next, the theory's constitutive and governing equations and their associated material parameters are described. These equations are then specialized for different simplifying geometries: unbounded problem domains, uniaxial strain, plane strain, radial symmetry, and axisymmetry. Example problems from geomechanics, hydrogeology, and petroleum engineering are incorporated throughout to illustrate poroelastic behavior and solution methods for a wide variety of real-world scenarios. The final chapter provides outlines for finite-element and boundary-element formulations of the field's governing equations. Whether read as a course of study or consulted as a reference by researchers and professionals, this volume's user-friendly presentation makes accessible one of geophysics' most important subjects and will do much to reduce poroelasticity's reputation as difficult to master.},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-1240},
	abstract = {Die petrophysikalischen Eigenschaften von Rotliegend Sandsteinen aus der Geothermie-Bohrung Groß Schönebeck 3/90 wurden im Labor unter poroelastischer Verformung untersucht. Dazu wurde der Porendruck in einer triaxialen Hochdruckpresse unter einachsiger Verformung variiert und axiale Verformung, Permeabilität, Formationswiderstandsfaktor und Ultraschallwellengeschwindigkeiten gleichzeitig und kontinuierlich gemessen. Ziel war die Untersuchung des hydromechanischen Langzeitverhaltens der Sandsteinmatrix bei Porendruckänderungen, wie sie in situ durch die Förderung und Injektion von Thermalwasser hervorgerufen werden. Nach Ermittlung petrophysikalischer Eigenschaften von 29 Kernproben durch Standardlaborverfahren wurden vier standortrepräsentative Sandsteine unterschiedlicher Reservoirqualität ausgewählt. Die Charakterisierung der Porenraumstruktur dieser Sandsteine erfolgte mittels Quecksilberintrusionsmessungen und Bildanalyse von Gesteinsdünnschliffen vor und nach der Verformung. In den Hochdruckexperimenten stellt sich bei Senkung des Porendrucks unter einachsiger Verformung der Spannungspfad abhängig von den gesteinsmechanischen Eigenschaften ein und die Anisotropie des Spannungszustands nimmt zu. Die Ergebnisse für eine Porendrucksenkung von 40 {MPa} zeigen, dass die aus der Volumendehnung berechneten Porositätsänderungen mit maximal 6 ‰ der in situ Porosität sehr gering sind. Die Ultraschallwellengeschwindigkeiten steigen mit der Porendrucksenkung linear um 2 bis 5 m/s/{MPa}. Die Abnahme der Permeabilität bei Messung in Richtung der größten Hauptspannung beträgt maximal 13 \% der in situ Permeabilität. Bei Sandsteinen mit einer Ausgangsporosität unter 15 \% tritt unter hoher Differenzspannung ein nichtlinearer Anstieg der Permeabilität mit sinkendem Porendruck auf. Die Formationswiderstandsfaktoren steigen mit dem abnehmenden Porendruck linear um 5 bis 25 \%. Die gewonnenen Ergebnisse der porendruckgesteuerten, anisotropen Belastung werden über die mittlere effektive Spannung gegenüber der isotropen Belastung interpretiert. Außerdem werden Zusammenhänge diskutiert, die in der Bohrlochgeophysik genutzt werden, um die lagerstättenrelevanten Eigenschaften, Porosität und Permeabilität, aus in situ leichter messbaren Größen, wie z.B. dem Formationswiderstandsfaktor oder den Ultraschallwellengeschwindigkeiten, abzuleiten. Es zeigt sich, dass die Deformation der Porenraumstruktur eine überproportionale Änderung der struktursensitiven Parameter gegenüber der Porosität bewirkt. Bei hoher Spannungsanisotropie korrelieren Permeabilität und Formationsfaktor nicht und zeigen, dass Ladungs- und Fluidtransport unterschiedlichen Wegen durch das Porensystem folgen. Während die Permeabilität niedrig poröser Sandsteine mit dem Öffnen von Rissporen bei einem hohen Verhältnis aus Differenz- zu mittlerer Effektivspannung ansteigt, wird der Formationswiderstandsfaktor von der fortschreitenden Gesamtkompaktion bestimmt. Das spannungsinduzierte Öffnen von Mikrorissen, die in Richtung der größten Hauptspannung verlaufen, passt gut in das Bild des hydromechanischen Gesteinsverhaltens im Übergang von elastischer zu plastischer Verformung. Aufgrund der linearen Spannungs-Dehnungs-Beziehungen sowie der kleinen Änderungen der petrophysikalischen Parameter und der unveränderten petrophysikalischen und strukturellen Eigenschaften der entlasteten Gesteine, wird das Verformungsregime makroskopisch als elastisch interpretiert. Für die Bohrung Groß Schönebeck 3/90 bedeutet dies, dass selbst bei einer Lagerstättendrucksenkung von 40 {MPa} ein Versagen der Sandsteinmatrix verbunden mit drastischen Permeabilitätsverlusten nicht zu erwarten ist. Die Produktivität der Lagerstätte wird daher vor allem durch das hydraulische Langzeitverhalten der in situ stimulierten Risse bestimmt werden.},

	abstract = {Natural gas production from some Rotliegend reservoirs in the Netherlands and North Germany has triggered seismic events after the affected sites had undergone a significant decrease in pore pressure. Recent seismic events in North Germany have caused negligible structural damage but major public concern in a region of low historic seismicity. In a first order approach, the pore pressure depletion of deep reservoirs is accompanied by stress changes that superimpose on pre-production and far-field stresses and potentially question the strength of pre-existing fault planes. Basic analytic models can explain how first, the production-induced differential increase of effective vertical and horizontal stress components within the reservoir, and second the compensation of reservoir contraction by compatibility stresses in the reservoir surroundings, can lead to the reactivation of pre-existing faults during depletion. These analytic approaches fail however to account for the mechanical stratigraphy and structural complexities occurring in reality. 
In this study, general characteristics of Rotliegend gas fields were depicted in 2D Finite element models in order to improve the quantitative understanding of production-induced seismicity and identify geological parameters that may favour the occurrence of seismicity in North Germany. The tendency towards normal faulting was investigated for a parameter space of reservoir depth, reservoir thickness, mechanical and hydraulic properties and compartment geometries. Distinct features of the local geology such as a varying thickness of viscoelastic salt in the overburden and offset reservoir compartments were addressed by three basic model settings whereby a graben setting served as a reference scenario. The consolidation procedure of the {FE}- multiphysics tool {ABAQUS} was used to solve the fully coupled poroelastic equations, requiring the establishment of a modelling strategy first. Herein the Biot-coefficient, that commonly assumes values inferior to one in solid rocks, constituted a crucial model parameter. In the numerical procedure, the evaluation of failure and output of Terzaghi effective stress ignored the Biot-coefficient at first glance. It is however shown that the coefficient scales with total stresses and governs the magnitudes of both effective stress concepts, the Biot-Willis effective stress, reflecting the direct poroelastic stress-strain relation, and Terzaghi effective stress determining the yield of porous rock formations under large confining pressures. A second crucial feature, the deterministic model fault was depicted by contact surfaces that capture the discontinuous character of real faults and allow for relative displacements. In the poroelastic modelling, sealing faults invoke continuity constraints that, along with an inconvenient definition of failure stress, lead to the introduction of the fault-loading parameter {SSR}, used for the comparative evaluation of fault-loading in different model variations. Identified critical fault-loading patterns were in a second modelling campaign allowed to dissipate by means of dynamic slip, whereby the implementation of slip-rate weakening friction and the consideration of dynamic stresses in {ABAQUS} explicit captured essential characteristics of dynamic rupture.
Several factors that may favour production-induced seismicity in North Germany were identified in the modelling. First, individual parameters such as large reservoir thickness, large Biot-coefficients of the reservoir, shallow reservoir position, a large stiffness contrast between caprock and reservoir and in particular the effect of viscoelastic evaporites in the overburden, exerting a non-homogeneous load and inhibiting stress redistribution, are factors favouring the reactivation of the graben-bounding fault. Second, intra-field compartmentalizing faults are found a more likely location for seismic events than the graben boundary. Particularly production scenarios that deplete either both of two offset compartments, or the footwall compartment, exert a strong loading on the fault. Furthermore, partly-juxtaposed reservoir compartments constitute a preferential geometric setting for fault reactivation. A favoured reactivation of steeply dipping faults ({\textgreater} 60°) in all models reflects a dominant contribution of compaction-strains to fault-loading and contrasts with tectonic concepts. The fault reactivation potential on the graben boundary is found to be highest at the upper reservoir level and a narrow interval above it. For the intra-field setting, rupture initiates at the lower level of the fault section bounding the footwall compartment. Rupture generally propagates either downwards or simultaneously up– and downwards. Thereby, the interplay of the overall stress state and the initial acceleration can favour or inhibit slip propagation but the isotropic stress state within the salt and the tendency for reverse faulting below the reservoir pose ultimate geologic barriers to the propagation of rupture. The final rupture pattern depends predominantly on the geological setting and its local stress state, whereas the effect of the simulated depletion scenarios is hardly distinguishable.
Bulk formation strain is shown to be ambiguously expressed by two different effective stress concepts, moreover, the modelling results reveal a strong sensitivity on the representation of the fault. These findings of the study highlight specific challenges of the modelling of reservoir geomechanical problems. Reviewing the model results, a single dominant parameter for seismic hazard cannot be derived as fault criticality is predominantly governed by a complex interplay of initial stresses, pore pressure and fault strength. The investigated parameters revealed the potential to enhance or mitigate critical tendencies in an interfering manner. In consequence, more detailed prediction models require more detailed structural and field data. Nevertheless, the {FE} models enhance the understanding of processes and influential parameters for induced seismicity and are able to investigate scenarios and define limiting cases in the planning and operation of fields. The presented two-step approach, encompassing the prioritized identification of critically stressed faults and the separate simulation of rupture can be extended to case investigations addressing for example problems of caprock integrity.},

This is done through the investigation of two examples, both of which are excavation analyses modelling a sequential excavation process. The first example is a three-dimensional elastic analysis of a tunnel constructed in soft rock layer. The second example is an axi-symmetric elasto-plastic analysis of a shaft constructed in slightly overconsolidated clay layer. In order to clarify the effect of sequential excavation process on the analysis results, a conventional two-dimensional analysis on each example is also carried out. Through this study, we will demonstrate that it is essential to consider in detail the incremental advance of a tunnel face when one investigates the change of pore water pressure and stresses surrounding a tunnel face during excavation. Additionally, on the basis of the analytical results obtained, a proposal is presented for evaluating the stability of rock mass surrounding a tunnel during construction.

It closely relates to the accuracy, computing time and efforts required for meshing of finite element models, which determines their complexity level. This paper presents study of the effects of mesh size on accuracy of numerical analysis results. Based on these results the guidelines for choosing the appropriate mesh strategy in finite element modelling are provided. The static and buckling analysis is carried out to know the effects of mesh sizes by using Femap and {NX}-Nastran. The model under study is of a structure made up of steel plate.},

	abstract = {Smart grid systems are characterized by high complexity due to interactions between a traditional passive network and active power electronic components, coupled using communication links. Additionally, automation and information technology plays an important role in order to operate and optimize such cyber-physical energy systems with a high(er) penetration of fluctuating renewable generation and controllable loads. As a result of these developments the validation on the system level becomes much more important during the whole engineering and deployment process, today. In earlier development stages and for larger system configurations laboratory-based testing is not always an option. Due to recent developments, simulation-based approaches are now an appropriate tool to support the development, implementation, and roll-out of smart grid solutions. This paper discusses the current state of simulation-based approaches and outlines the necessary future research and development directions in the domain of power and energy systems.},

Combining simulators of different domains into a joint experiment, co-simulation provides a holistic framework to consider the whole {CPES} at system level. In this paper, we present a systematic structuration of co-simulation based on a conceptual point of view. A co-simulation framework is then considered in its conceptual, semantic, syntactic, dynamic and technical layers. Coupling methods are investigated and classified according to these layers. This paper would serve as a solid theoretical base for specification of future applications of co-simulation and selection of coupling methods in {CPES} assessment and validation.},

	abstract = {A small strain plasticity model, based on the principles of continuum mechanics, is incorporated into a phase-field model for heterogeneous microstructures in polycrystalline and multiphase material systems (Nestler et al., Phys Rev 71:1–6, 2005). Thereby, the displacement field is computed by solving the local momentum balance dynamically (Spatschek et al., Phys Rev 75:1–14, 2007) using the finite difference method on a staggered grid. The elastic contribution is expressed as the linear approximation according to the Cauchy stress tensor. In order to calculate the plastic strain, the Prandtl–Reuss model is implemented consisting of an associated flow rule in combination with the von Mises yield criterion and a linear isotropic hardening approximation. Simulations are performed illustrating the evolution of the stress and plastic strain using a radial return mapping algorithm for single phase system and two phase microstructures. As an example for interface evolution coupling with elasto-plastic effects, we present crack propagation simulations in ductile material.},

	abstract = {Co-simulation techniques have evolved signiﬁcantly over the last 10 years. System simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing are used to develop complex products in many industrial sectors. The Functional Mock-Up Interface ({FMI}) represents a standardized solution for integration of simulation models, tools and solvers. In practice the integration and coupling of heterogeneous systems still require enormous eﬀorts. Until now no standardized interface or protocol speciﬁcation is available, which allows the interaction of real-time and non-real-time systems of diﬀerent vendors. This paper presents selected technical aspects of the novel Distributed Co-simulation Protocol ({DCP}) and highlights primary application possibilities. The {DCP} consists of a data model, a ﬁnite state machine, and a communication protocol including a set of protocol data units. It supports a master-slave architecture for simulation setup and control. The {DCP} was developed in context of the {ACOSAR} project and was subsequently adopted by Modelica Association as a Modelica Association Project ({MAP}). It may be used in numerous industrial and scientiﬁc applications. The standardization of the {DCP} allows for a modular and interoperable development between system providers and integrators. In the end, this will lead to more eﬃcient product development and testing.},

The uniformity of deformation of the rock specimen was improved by minimizing specimen bulging due to specimen slenderness and end-surface frictional constraints. The improvements in the instrumentation were aimed at improving the monitoring of the applied forces, axial and radial deformations, and macroscopic rock failure through use of high precision {LVDTs} and cantilever gauges, acoustic emission measurements and acoustic pulse transmission velocities. The second objective was to obtain test data for the constitutive modelling and calibration of Red Wildmoor sandstone under various saturating conditions and saturation fluids. An additional task was an experi mental study for the improvement of the uniaxial compression test as an index text for rock mechanics applications. The performed modifications allowed the reliable collection of post-peak stress test data of material softening behaviour, and the identification of the point of macroscopic failure of the specimen beyond which the test data cannot be used directly for continuum modelling of material behaviour. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hydrostatic and triaxial compression tests have been conducted on nominally dry samples of Bentheim sandstone, a homogeneous quartz-rich sandstone with porosity of about 23\%. A broad range of confining pressures were used to observe the transition from the brittle faulting to cataclastic flow regime. Mechanical data for the brittle strength and compactive yield stress can be fitted with empirical envelopes that have been shown to be applicable to other porous sandstones. However, the Bentheim sandstone is somewhat unusual in that quasiductile failure (characterized by an overall hardening trend punctuated by episodic strain softening and compaction band formation) was observed over a wide range of confining pressures from 120 {MPa} to 300 {MPa}. Since this failure mode is similar to observations in honeycombed cellular solids, it is speculated that the prevalence of quasiductile failure in the Bentheim sandstone arises from its relatively homogeneous mineralogy and grain size. Compaction band formation may be inhibited in other sandstones with higher fractions of feldspar and clay, as well as more disperse grain sizes.},

To obtain representative properties for describing the mechanical behavior of this material, large scale triaxial tests were performed. Specimens with a size of 60 cm diameter and 120 cm height composed of sandstone and claystone beds were tested in triaxial compression using a multi-stage technique. The specimens showed a ductile behavior for the stress regime tested. The strength parameters were calculated according to the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion. The axial and volumetric deformations were measured and the viscosity of the composite rock material was assessed by deformation rate alterations. For some specimens, direct shear tests were conducted in samples containing joints. The results of the tests show that the failure of the bedded specimens was given by the combined failure of both materials. This was confirmed by a numerical model including rock discontinuities.},

	abstract = {Acoustic emission ({AE}) and microseismic ({MS}) events are indicators of rock fracturing or damage as the rock is brought to failure at high stress. By capturing the {AE}/{MS} events, underground excavation induced rock mass degradation or damage can be located and evaluated. A better understanding of the extent and shape of the excavation damaged zone ({EDZ}) or yield zone around caverns helps to arrive at safe and economic design and construction of the caverns. For this purpose, one needs to understand the {AE} mechanism associated with the excavation process. In the present study, a coupled numerical method is used to study {AE} at the Kannagawa underground powerhouse cavern in Japan. Two codes, Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua ({FLAC}), a finite difference code and Particle Flow Code ({PFC}), a distinct element code, are coupled. The motive to apply the {FLAC}/{PFC} coupled approach is to take advantage of each modeling scheme while at the same time minimizing the requirement for computational resources. The coupling is realized through an exchange of displacements, velocities, and forces in each cycling step. The rock mass surrounding an {AE} sensor is modeled using {PFC} and the remaining rock mass is modeled with {FLAC} to consider the geological complexity and the excavation sequence. In this manner, the {AE} activities at {AE} sensor locations of the Kannagawa cavern were simulated and found to be in good agreement with field monitoring results. This approach takes account of stress redistribution and provides stress and displacement patterns in the rock mass that are consistent with {AE} observations for excavation design. The observed {AE} activities in the rock mass can thus be utilized to assess the effectiveness of the rock support system and the overall stability of the cavern.},

	abstract = {Some of the most challenging aspects of design in moderately to heavily jointed rock masses relate to the impacts of in-situ joint fabric on rock mass behavior. Preferred joint orientations can induce a marked anisotropy in modulus, strength and brittleness. In addition, joint density and persistence must be considered relative to problem size, as rock mass properties can exhibit significant scale dependence. Synthetic Rock Mass ({SRM}) testing provides a means to study these effects in simulated rock mass samples on the scale of 10 to 100 meters. This paper focuses on a technique to account for strength anisotropy and scale effects (as quantified through {SRM} testing) within large-scale {FLAC}3D continuum models. This follows the work of Clark (2006), who used {FLAC} to demonstrate that the assignment of ubiquitous joint orientations at the zone level (from a known joint-orientation distribution) results in realistic rock mass behavior and yields properties that are consistent with empirical techniques. The resulting calibrated {FLAC}3D material incorporates several key behaviors obtained from {SRM} testing and can be used in large-scale continuum models for analysis and design.},

When investigating the hydraulic or mechanical parameters important for geotechnical applications (e.g. large-scale triaxial tests), it is necessary to have an understanding of the integrated effects of the fractures forming the fracture networks. In this paper, a method is presented whereby undisturbed samples with a diameter of 30 cm were recovered from a highly fractured porous rock mass and prepared for investigation of the fracture network properties in a laboratory. Most of the samples recovered contained several differently orientated fractures forming an interconnected network. The undisturbed nature of the recovered samples allows the hydrogeological and geotechnical characteristics of the fracture network to be investigated.},

	abstract = {Microcracking (crack growth), along with accumulation of inelastic strain, takes place in crystalline rock such as granite when it is subjected to differential stress. As a result, growing cracks become interconnected, completely altering permeability. Therefore, coupling between crack growth and permeability change must be determined to fully understand the hydro-mechanical response of rocks subjected to non-hydrostatic stress. Damage growth in triaxial tests on Inada granite under confining pressures up to 140 {MPa} was analyzed using the crack tensor concept proposed by Oda (Soils and Foundations 22 (4) (1982) 96), and permeability change was also formulated in terms of damage growth. Transient pulse tests were carried out on the damaged samples to see if the permeability change is really related to the associated damage growth. The conclusions are summarized as follows: A permeability tensor formulated by microstructural parameters is well supported by the transient pulse tests. This is particularly true when we deal with highly damaged granite. Where crack density is low, however, the hydraulic properties must be considered by taking into account the effect of spherical pores on them. The permeability of the sample subjected to increasing stress up to failure is about two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of intact granite under the same confining pressure (140 {MPa}). This change is surprisingly large compared with the result by Zoback and Byerlee (J. Geophys. Res. 80 (5) (1975) 752). Permeability tensors of the damaged samples are represented as more or less isotropic tensors. Rocks under stress in the field can be regarded as isotropic porous media, in spite of the fact that cracks grow preferentially parallel to the major stress.},

A transient method was used, in which the decay of a small incremental change of pressure was observed; decay characteristics, when combined with dimensions of the sample and compressibility and viscosity of the fluid (water or argon) yielded permeability, k. k of the granite ranged from 350 nd (nanodarcy = 10−17 cm2) at 100-bar pressure to 4 nd at 4000 bars. Based on linear decay characteristics, Darcy's law apparently held even at this lowest value. Both k and electrical resistivity, ρs, of Westerly granite vary markedly with pressure, and the two are closely related by k = Cρs−1.5±0.1, where C is a constant. With this relationship, an extrapolated value of k at 10-kb pressure would be about 0.5 nd. This value is roughly equivalent to flow rates involved in solute diffusion but is still a great deal more rapid than volume diffusion. Measured permeability and porosity enable hydraulic radius and, hence, the shape of pore spaces in the granite to be estimated. The shapes (flat slits at low pressure, equidimensional pores at high pressure) are consistent with those deduced from elastic characteristics of the rock. From the strong dependence of k on effective pressure, rocks subject to high pore pressure will probably be relatively permeable.},

Although the model is a very simple representation of the complicated pore phase in rock, we find that it provides an adequate simulation of how the transport properties vary with external pressure. Expressions derived for fluid permeability k and formation factor F are combined to give an expression for the mean hydraulic radius of the pore phase. Using this expression, we show that the exponent r in the empirical relationship k ∝ F−r must fall in the range 1≤r≤3. Also, we use the expression for hydraulic radius to estimate the crack area per unit volume and the standard deviation of the height of the asperities on the rhicrocrack surfaces for two granites. The values are in reasonable agreement with other estimates.},

	abstract = {The influence of stress paths on the mechanical behavior and coupled permeability evolution of quartz sand packings and soft sandstone have been investigated. The proposed approach is mainly based on the performing drained compression tests keeping constant a stress path parameter K, defined as the ratio of the horizontal to vertical effective stress increments. Macroscopic mechanical data and the stress path dependency of permeability have been measured in the elastic, brittle and compaction regimes. The micro-structural characteristics of unconsolidated materials—coarse rounded grains (glass beads—{GB}) and angular grains (Durance sand—{DS})—and a weakly consolidated sandstone (Otter Sherwood sandstone—{OSS}) have been quantified in intact and deformed states combining petrophysical core analysis and multi-scale imaging according to the feasibility of sub-sampling of the different materials. Two different types of hydro-mechanical behavior were evidenced for each material. The weakly consolidated {OSS} presents a mechanical behavior similar to the consolidated rocks with two distinct regimes of deformation; the transition between these two regimes is a function of the stress path. On the other hand, the sand shows a gradual transition regime requiring the use of a curvature criterion to pick yield stresses; this criterion has been validated on the basis of acoustic emissions analysis. The modified Cam-Clay model and the elliptical cap model allow capturing efficiently the yield envelopes. The permeability measurements were performed with intermediate pressure ports to measure accurately the high permeable sand and to avoid end-effects. For {OSS}, permeability evolutions follow closely the volumetric strain evolutions in both the elastic and plastic regimes and are mainly controlled by the mean pressure before yield. At these critical stresses, the permeability drops drastically under the influence of deviatoric stress. Conversely for {DS}, the correlation between strain and permeability is not obvious as permeability reduction is pronounced at an early stage of loading.},

	abstract = {Permeability is the most important petrophysical property in tight gas reservoirs. Many researchers have worked on permeability measurement methods, but there is no universal method yet which can predict permeability in the whole field and in all intervals of the wells. So artificial intelligence methods have been used to predict permeability by using well log data in all field areas. In this research, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Support Vector Machine techniques have been employed to predict permeability of Mesaverde tight gas sandstones located in Washakie basin in {USA}. Multilayer Perceptrons are the most used neural networks in regression tasks. Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is a method which combines fuzzy model and neural network in a manner to produce accurate results. Support Vector Machine is a relatively new intelligence method with great capabilities in regression and classification tasks. Each method has advantages and disadvantage and here their capability in predicting permeability has been evaluated. In this study, data from three wells were used and two different dataset patterns were constructed to evaluate performances of the models in predicting permeability by using either previously seen data or unseen data. The most important aspect of this research is investigation of capability of these methods to generalize the training patterns to previously unseen data. Results showed that all methods have acceptable performance in predicting permeability but Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Support Vector Machine performs so better than Multilayer Perceptron and predict permeability more accurate.},

	abstract = {Rock is generally complex and heterogeneous, therefore the heterogeneity effects of effective stress and temperature on permeability should be taken into account. In this study, two-part Hooke's model ({TPHM}) is introduced to understand the influences of effective stress and temperature on permeability of soft and hard parts (two parts) of rock based on coupling thermo-hydro-mechanical tests. Under a fixed temperature level (25 °C, 35 °C, 50 °C, 65 °C, 80 °C, 90 °C and 95 °C), the tests were carried out in a conventional triaxial system whereas the confining pressure was remained at 50 {MPa}, and the pore pressure was increased to the specified levels step by step, i.e. 8 {MPa}, 18 {MPa}, 28 {MPa}, 38 {MPa}, 41 {MPa}, 44 {MPa}, 46 {MPa} and 48 {MPa}. The temperature-dependent relationships for two parts permeabilities are proposed on the basis of the initial test results. We point out that temperature of 65 °C–90 °C is the threshold for the development of {CO}2-plume geothermal ({CPG}) reservoir sandstone cracking under low effective stress (2–9 {MPa}) based on the relationship between temperature and soft part permeability. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of temperature on the two parts in the rock. The results indicate that as the temperature increases from 25 °C to 65 °C, the flow channel in the hard part has a stronger response to temperature than that in the soft part at a fixed effective stress level, which is opposite to the situation of effective stress. Considering that natural rock is generally heterogeneous with non-uniform pore structure, we suggest a physical interpretation of the phenomenon that before the thermal cracking threshold the two parts have different responses to temperature.},

The samples were held for 24h under the target consolidation pressure, and then constant strain-rate compression was applied measuring permeability. The structural changes were measured by thin section image analysis and micro-focus X-ray computed tomography. For the Shikotsu welded tuff, the permeability decreased monotonously with axial compression, mainly due to pore collapse. For the Kimachi sandstone, the permeability first decreased with increasing axial stress, then began to increase when the total lateral strain recovered its value before the application of confining pressure, and then maintained an almost constant value in the post-peak region. The minimum and final permeability decreased with increasing confining pressure mainly due to compaction and large plastic deformation of clay cementing materials. For the Inada granite, the tendency of permeability change during axial compression was almost the same as for the Kimachi sandstone. The final permeability was larger than that before compression, and the permeability decreased with smaller confining pressure mainly due to a decrease in the number and width of rupture planes and the absence of axial cracks from biotite. The permeability, however, increased under larger confining pressures mainly due to the formation of subrupture planes caused by the high stress concentration at the rough and stiff rupture plane under large confining pressure.},

Such reservoirs have very low permeability (usually below 0.1 {mD}) and show a strong stress sensitivity to fluid transport properties and a considerable productivity decline during the production process due to increasing effective stress. In an experimental study, several measurement series were performed on plugs from the North-German Rotliegend tight gas reservoirs to improve knowledge and understanding of the effects of changing stress and pore pressure conditions on reservoir rocks, during gas production. In addition to the experimental study, an Interactive Rock Data Catalog ({IRDC}) has been developed, which contains a database coupled with a correlation module. The database contains metadata of the fields and wellbores included in the {IRDC}, the corresponding log data and petrophysical data. The correlation module contains correlations derived both from the study measurements and from literature. The results of this study will enable reservoir engineers to select specific data from the database and process it in the correlation module to generate secondary sets of data, which can then be used for modeling and simulation of tight gas reservoirs.},

Pore pressure dependence of petrophysical properties have been measured under uniaxial strain boundary conditions, i.e., zero lateral strain at constant overburden pressure. Permeability, formation resistivity factor, and compressional as well as shear wave velocities were recorded simultaneously and continuously during deformation in direction of maximum principal stress. The results show that the stress development is specific for different sandstones depending on the efficiency of pore pressure. The stress anisotropy increases with decreasing pore pressure, leading to stress-induced anisotropy of pore structure with preferred closure of horizontally oriented pore space. Permeability decline of initially lower permeability sandstones indicate the opening of axially oriented pores at lower pore pressure.},

A new technique of measuring permeability by a steady-state method, while continuously deforming the rock specimen, has been developed. Permeability reduction due to hydrostatic loading was found to be similar to permeability reduction due to stress-induced compaction in the pre-failure region. This is considered as a first proof of the validity of the new method. Deformation experiments in the brittle field show that low-porosity sandstones have a permeability evolution in triaxial compression which is qualitatively similar to crystalline rocks. In the pre-failure region permeability is strongly reduced by stress-induced compaction. After the onset of dilatancy, permeability starts to increase; however, when the initial sample volume is reached again, the permeability reduction is not recovered.},

Contributors focus on the characterization of reservoir processes and cover topics ranging from surface roughness in porous media and reservoir characterization at the mesoscopic scale to shale clast heterogeneities and their effect on fluid flow, permeability patterns in fluvial sandstones, and reservoir management using 3-D seismic data. This book is organized into six sections encompassing 43 chapters. The first 20 chapters deal with reservoir characterization at the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic scales. Topics include low-contrast resistivity sandstone formations; the use of centrifuge and computer tomography to quantify saturation distribution and capillary pressures; and cross-well seismology as a tool for reservoir geophysics. The chapters that follow deal with reservoir characterization at the megascopic scale; fractal heterogeneity of clastic reservoirs; heterogeneity and effective permeability of porous rocks; and drilling fluid design based on reservoir characterization. A chapter that outlines a procedure for estimating permeability anisotropy with a minipermeameter concludes the book. This book is a valuable resource for students and practitioners of petroleum engineering, geology and geological engineering, petroleum exploration, and geophysics.},

We focus on laboratory processes, namely, plastic compaction of aggregates, elastic-brittle deformation of granular rocks, dilatant and thermal microcracking of dense rocks, chemically driven processes, as a way to approach naturally occurring geological processes. In particular, the chemically driven processes and their corresponding evolution permeability-porosity relationships are discussed in relation to sedimentary rocks diagenesis.},

This approach captures heterogeneities in soil samples utilized in laboratory testing and results in quick and less tedious predictions compared to the existing methods. In this paper, an experimental setup is developed specifically to validate numerical predictions of the soil water retention curve ({SWRC}) for two types of sands with identical size but distinct grain morphology of round (Ottawa sand) and angular particle shape (Q-Rok). The complex 3D pore network is captured noninvasively using high-resolution attenuation-based X-ray computed tomography. The numerical predictions are carried out by solving a Young-Laplace equation using the pore morphology method. The experimental results and numerical predictions match well, including the effect of hysteresis in {SWRC} measurements. The spatial distribution of pore water and pore air corresponding to different capillary suctions is obtained from numerical predictions, providing greater insights into the hydromechanical behavior of partially saturated soils. The sensitivity of the voxel size on simulations is quantified by predicting the pore size distribution of Ottawa sand at three different tomography resolutions.},

It considers key practical issues such as prediction of pore pressure, estimation of hydrocarbon column heights and fault seal potential, determination of optimally stable well trajectories, casing set points and mud weights, changes in reservoir performance during depletion, and production-induced faulting and subsidence. The book establishes the basic principles involved before introducing practical measurement and experimental techniques to improve recovery and reduce exploitation costs. It illustrates their successful application through case studies taken from oil and gas fields around the world. This book is a practical reference for geoscientists and engineers in the petroleum and geothermal industries, and for research scientists interested in stress measurements and their application to problems of faulting and fluid flow in the crust.},

Special attention was paid to the avoidance of air and water leakage through the membrane in the long-term tests. The experiments show that the nature of creep strains is similar to that of plastic strains. They may be predicted from the framework provided by the hardening plasticity theory. In particular, the potential surface determined for the prediction of plastic strains may also be used for the prediction of time-dependent creep strains. From the experiments it also appears that the yield surface and the plastic potential surface move out together, and the point at which to evaluate inelastic strain increment directions is the current location of the yield surface and the accompanying plastic potential surface.},

This paper presents an original method for evaluating the shear strength of such materials, based on size effects in granular materials affected by grain breakage according to fracture mechanics. Through a general size effect relation operating on shear strength envelopes, this method makes it possible to determine the shear strength of a coarse-grained granular material from the measured properties of a finer-grained granular material made of the same mineral. In the paper, the method is explicitly proved, taking into account the statistical distribution of breakage resistances of particles with different sizes, within materials that can be considered as physically similar, particularly having parallel grain size distributions and the same compactness. A wide set of independent experimental results is shown to validate the method consistently.},

	abstract = {Urban soft-ground tunneling projects involve significant risks related to the spatial variability and uncertainty in geotechnical parameters. However, standard practice typically does not incorporate spatial trends into risk assessment. Geostatistical methods provide a means not only for predicting geotechnical parameter values spatially, but also for modeling the heterogeneity and spatial uncertainty that play a key role in probabilistic risk assessment for tunnel construction. Before incorporating geostatistical analysis into the risk assessment for soft-ground tunneling works, it is necessary to identify best practices with respect to geostatistical methods. In this paper, two approaches were examined and compared for modeling the spatial variability and uncertainty of key geotechnical parameters relevant to shield tunneling in soils. The first approach consisted of the sequential Gaussian simulation of parameters using a single spatial variance model for each respective parameter, which is a common approach adopted in the literature but does not incorporate variability and uncertainty in geological units. The second approach considered the influence of geology by basing the sequential Gaussian simulation of geotechnical parameters on geological unit simulations using a transition probability-based stochastic model. In this approach, a unique spatial variance model of the geotechnical parameter for each geological unit was considered. The results from this analysis revealed that the influence of geology is critical to the spatial modeling of geotechnical parameters and their uncertainty, and, therefore, must be incorporated into the geostatistical analysis for the risk assessment of soft-ground tunneling works.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The installation of shallow foundation systems for offshore wind turbines like gravity foundations requires the excavation of the weak top soil of the seabed to place the structure on more stable ground. This excavation can be done through suction dredging resulting in a pit. Different slope angles of this pit can be realized using this technique. As the failure mechanisms of artificial submarine slopes using suction dredging are barely investigated, relatively small final slope angles of max. 10 degree are reached to guarantee stability. Nevertheless, small-scale experiments show that submarine slopes with overcritical slope inclinations can be stable for a while when prepared with suction dredging. Steeper inclinations would significantly reduce the disturbance of the marine fauna and the amount of sand to be removed and therefore meet both economic and ecological interests. The investigations of the failure mechanism in the submarine slope during suction dredging are carried out with a coupled Euler-Lagrange approach, namely the combination of the Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) and the Discrete Element Method ({DEM}). This method enables the computation of particle-particle as well as the fluid-particle interaction forces and hence their influence on the investigated submarine slope behavior. The calculations are carried out with the open source software package {CFDEM}® coupling, which combines the discrete element code {LIGGGHTS}® with {CFD} solvers based on {OpenFOAM}®. Additionally, small scale model tests of suction dredging of sandy submarine slopes are carried out. The displacement of the soil grains is monitored with a high-speed camera. To take into account effects of contractancy and dilatancy, a loosely and a densely packed sand are investigated and the influence of the packing density on the failure mechanism is evaluated. The experimentally gained results will be compared to the numerical ones to evaluate the capability of the coupled {CFD}-{DEM} method to depict the failure behavior of submarine slopes during suction dredging.},

	abstract = {Die Rotliegend-Vulkanite aus dem Norddeutschen Becken ({NDB}) sind in jüngster Zeit stärker in den Fokus geothermischer Betrachtung gerückt. Ein wichtiger Meilenstein war das Forschungsprojekt Groß Schönebeck, bei dem wider Erwarten die Vulkanite als sekundärer Zielhorizont die besten Voraussetzungen 
für eine geothermische Erschließung boten. Über die hydraulisch/mechanischen Eigenschaften der Vulkanite im Untergrund ist jedoch kaum etwas bekannt und auch die Oberflächenäquivalente sind hinsichtlich geothermisch relevanter Parameter weitgehend unerforscht. Aus den positiven Erfahrungen des Standorts Schönebeck entstand die Motivation einer umfangreichen Analyse der Rotliegend-Vulkanite mit Blick auf eine tiefengeothermische Nutzung. Es wurden thermische, felsmechanische und petrophysikalische Untersuchungen von sieben Oberflächenäquivalenten durchgeführt; drei der Oberflächengesteine 
sowie zwei Tiefenbohrungen wurden ferner hinsichtlich auftretender Kluftmuster analysiert. Die Daten fungieren als Eingangsparameter für hydraulische sowie hydromechanische numerische Modellierungen zur Potenzialabschätzung und zum Prozessverständnis. Die thermische Analyse der Gesteine ergab eine hohe Wärmeleitfähigkeit für die quarzreichen und dichten Vulkanitvarietäten. Durch die Wärmekapazität und die Reservoirtemperatur wurde das technische Strompotenzial 
für die Eruptionsstadien ermittelt. Das größte Potenzial liegt im explosiven Ignimbritstadium und im Post-Ignimbritstadium und wird auf einen Wert geschätzt, der allein dem 20-fachen des deutschen Jahresstromverbrauchs entspricht. Regional betrachtet ist das größte Potenzial bei Standortwahl im zentralen 
östlichen {NDB} zu erwarten. Die untersuchten Vulkanite sind überwiegend dicht und erfordern Stimulationsmaßnahmen für eine erfolgreiche Erschließung. Auch die stärker porösen Tuffe erreichen nicht die erforderliche Matrixpermeabilität 
für einen Porenleiter. Triaxiale Druckversuche unter in-situ Spannungsbedingungen haben jedoch gezeigt, dass es nur bedingt möglich ist, Risse im intakten Gestein zu erzeugen. Man ist folglich auf eine gestörte Kruste, also Klüfte im Gestein angewiesen. Sowohl die Oberflächengesteine als auch die Vulkanite im Untergrund sind nachweislich geklüftet. Das tektonische Grundmuster beschreibt Klüfte, die {NW}-{SE} bis {NNW}-{SSE} sowie {NE}-{SW} bis {NNE}-{SSW} orientiert sind und dabei steil einfallen. Die Scherfestigkeitskriterien der Kluftflächen liegen deutlich unterhalb derer für das intakte Gestein, so dass die Bedingung für eine Aktivierung der Klüfte im Spannungsfeld des {NDB} positiv bewertet wird. Die Kluftdaten wurden zum Zwecke numerischer Modellierungen in diskrete Kluftnetzwerkmodelle überführt. Hydraulische Modellierungen ergaben eine bevorzugte Fließrichtung in {NW}-{SE}. Die mit der Tiefe zunehmende Kluftschließung führt zu einer Durchlässigkeit, die für eine geothermische Nutzung nicht ausreichend ist, das Gestein muss hydraulisch stimuliert werden. Eine Stimulation der Kluftflächen zur Steigerung der Fließrate wurde mittels hydromechanischer Modellierungen erfolgreich dargestellt. Die wichtigsten Kriterien für eine erfolgreiche Stimulation sind die Geometrie des Kluftsystems und die Orientierung des Spannungsfelds. 
Aufgrund der überwiegend vertikalen Kluftflächen im Vulkanit und der hohen Vertikalspannung im tiefengeothermischen Reservoir wird eine Erschließung über das Multiriss-Konzept empfohlen. Durch den in der vorliegenden Arbeit dargestellten methodischen Ansatz kann mittels repräsentativer Eingangsparameter für einen Standort entsprechend der notwendige Injektionsdruck sowie die Art und Intensität der Verformung der Kluftflächen für eine hydraulische Stimulation prognostiziert werden.},

	abstract = {A new triaxial compression technique has made possible the study of laws of the fracture and flow of rocks under general triaxial stress states, in which all three principal stresses are different. By this new method, the effects of the stress states on fracture and yielding of rocks were experimentally studied. Fracture and flow properties of rocks are markedly affected not only by the least compression σ3, but also by the intermediate compression σ2. The stress states that produce fracture and yielding are determined by the following formulas: where ƒ1 and ƒ2 are monotonic increasing functions. The new failure criteria, corresponding to the generalized von Mises criteria, are physically interpreted as follows: fracture or yielding will occur when the distortional strain energy reaches a critical value that increases monotonically with the effective mean pressure: (σ1 + σ3)/2 for fracture and (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)/3 for yielding. The ductility defined as the permanent strain just before fracture, markedly increases with the increasing σ3 but decreases with increasing σ2. The influences of σ2 and σ3 on ductility are just the opposite. From these results on the effect of stress states, fracture and flow properties of the earth's upper mantle were deduced.},

	abstract = {The true triaxial test, which can simulate in-situ stress fields of nature which have different scalar quantity along three principal axes of stress, is the most effective experimental method for obtaining the mechanical and permeability property of rocks under overburden and tectonic stresses. The intermediate principal stress (σ2) is a control on the fracture strength, mechanical behavior and crack distribution of the deformed rocks. Thus, understanding the effect of the stress on the development of permeability anisotropy is crucial. To evaluate the influence of the σ2 on the permeability anisotropy, the permeability measurement lines in the σ1 and σ2 directions were added into an upgraded Mogi-type true triaxial test apparatus. We measured the permeability of Berea sandstone and Amatsu mudstone in the σ1 and σ2 direction under the conditions of true triaxial compression (σ3 {\textless} σ2 {\textless} σ1) with a constant σ3. In the Berea sandstone, we found that the permeability reduced with increasing mean stress and the magnitude of permeability anisotropy correlated with the intermediate principal stress. Photomicrographs and X-ray computed tomography observations for post-failure Berea sandstones revealed a phenomenon related to permeability: under high σ2 conditions, the fault gouge generated along final fractures causes permeability reduction of σ1 direction. For the Amatsu mudstone is too soft to be subject to brittle deformation. Thus, the development of the permeability anisotropy with increasing mean stresses was more pronounced in the Berea sandstone than the Amatsu mudstone.},

However, substantial progress in experimental and theoretical studies regarding the fully coupled effects of temperature, hydraulics and mechanics, as well as chemistry, in fractured porous media was just made in the last two decades due mainly to demands from the performance and safety assessment of high-level nuclear waste repositories. Numerical methods and computer codes have been developed successfully within the international {DECOVALEX} project (1992–2011). Meanwhile a wider range of applications associated with {THMC} coupled problems such as geothermal reservoir engineering, {CO}2-storage, construction of underground opening etc. can be found in the different international conferences, e.g. {GeoProc} (www.mech.uwa.edu.au/research/geoproc), {ComGeo} (www.com-geo.org/).},

Significant variations in gas density and viscosity can result also from temperature fluctuations (so-called Klinkenberg effect). According to the kinetic theory of gases, its viscosity should not depend on pressure. This is not necessarily the case for conditions typically existing in natural gas reservoirs [121]. At a fixed temperature, the viscosity of gas can vary by tens of percents as the formation pressure changes by a few Mega Pascale. Another problem concerns the evidence of turbulent flow, which results in additional friction effects.},

	abstract = {The upper parts of the ground usually belong to the vadose zone, i.e. the zone between land surface and the top of the upper aquifer. This zone is a transition section between the atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere and connects the neighboring compartments via air, water and solids including biomass and organic matter. The vadose zone can be roughly subdivided from top to bottom into a soil water zone, intermediate zone, and the capillary fringe. Only 0.0012\% of the global water reservoir or 0.05\% of the fresh water budget remains in soil. Compared with groundwater reservoirs, which store over 30\% of the global fresh water, the mass fraction of soil water within the hydraulic circle seems to be small, but is actually more dynamic. Water only resides in soil systems a few weeks on average, while groundwater systems can have residence times of several millenniums. Generally, the flow processes in soil take place under unsaturated conditions, i.e. the pore spaces are only partly filled with air and water. Moreover, such unsaturated conditions can occur in any multiphase regime where the water that partly fills the pore system is under suction and the pressure head is negative.},

In fact, the specific expression of the momentum balance (2.100) defines the equilibrium conditions in porous media here, considering swelling and thermal stresses caused by the coupling of mechanical to other physical and chemical processes. The effective stress principle has been established in order to define the stress state in the solid skeleton of porous media (cf. Sect. 2.5.1). Within this context, σeff indicates the stress tensor applied to a substitute continuum representing the solid skeleton smeared over the volume of the porous medium under consideration, and being characterized by a reduced partial density compared to the material density of the solid skeleton.},

In order to assess the feasibility as well as the safety of geotechnical applications, process-based modelling is the only tool to put numbers, i.e. to quantify future scenarios. This charges a huge responsibility concerning the reliability of computational tools. Benchmarking is an appropriate methodology to verify the quality of modelling tools based on best practices. Moreover, benchmarking and code comparison foster community efforts. The benchmark book is part of the {OpenGeoSys} initiative - an open source project to share knowledge and experience in environmental analysis and scientific computation.},
